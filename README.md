# Linear Regression Model: Ecommerce Spending Prediction 

## Project Overview
This project uses linear regression to predict yearly spending of e-commerce customers based on various engagement metrics. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- Dataset: [ecommerce_customers.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website)
- Features: Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership
- Target: Yearly Amount Spent
- Jupyter Notebook: [Linear Regression Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elsiemicah/linear-regression-model-with-insight)

## Steps
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building with Linear Regression
4. Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R-squared)

## Results
- **MAE**: 7.228
- **MSE**: 79.813
- **R-squared**: 0.989

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
